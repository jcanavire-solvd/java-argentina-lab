Objetives of this exercise: 

1. Override methods from class Object(toString, hashcode, equals) for at least 3 classes from the hierarchy. I overrrode this method in three files: "SanLorenzo", "Barcelona" and "DinamoMinsk". Also added a constructor statement to pass age as a parameter in "Barcelona" file. This is relevant to check how the hashCode() and the equals() are working.


2. Create a class hierarchy from a given set of themes. One of these was "Clubs de Futbol" (Football teams), so I used that for this exercise.
